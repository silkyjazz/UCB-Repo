ðŸ”‘ To access the professor data in the same query, we start by adding professor to the list of fields. Then, to display data from the Professor object, we use a sub-query to list the names of the fields from the Professor object. 

The following will return all classes, their name and the associated Professor Name

```graphql
query classes {
 classes {
   name
   professor {
    name
   }
 }
}
```

The following will return all schools, their name, location, and studentCount 

```graphql
query professors {
  schools {

    location
    studentCount
  }
}
```

The following will return all schools, their name, location, and studentCount 

```graphql
query professors {
  schools {
    name
    location
    studentCount
  }
}
```

The following will return all schools, their name, location, and studentCount and the assoicated classes for the associated school (name and building)

```graphql
query professors {
  schools {
    name
    location
    studentCount
    classes {
      name
      building
    }
  }
