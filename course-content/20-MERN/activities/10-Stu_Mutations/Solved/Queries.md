The following query returns all classes and the name id, and building

```graphql
query classes{
  classes {
    _id
    name
    building
  }
}
```


The following query returns a SPECIFIC class and the name by ID

```graphql
 query classVariable($id: ID!) {
  class(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}
```

`^` In our completed apps, the value for the variable is typically provided by the client. However, we can test the query using the GraphQL playground.

We enter the variable name and pass a value -- in JSON -- in the Query Variables pane, to test the query. We use just the variable name, not the $ identifier:

```graphql
{"id": "619ae0456c26299bbd006acf"}
```

```graphql
{"id" : "Add_Copied_ID_Here"}
```

Updating a Class

ðŸ”‘ We test if our resolver is now working by using an existing Class object id and adding the the provided test object to the Query Variable editor:


```graphql
 {
    "_id": "619ae0456c26299bbd006ad2",
    "name": "C++ for Programmers",
    "building": "SCI"
  }
```

```graphql
{
    "id": "619ae0456c26299bbd006ad2",
    "building": "AA"
}

```

ðŸ”‘ Next we run the provided mutation:


```graphql
mutation updateClass($id: ID!, $building: String!) {
    updateClass(id: $id, building: $building) {
      name
      building
    }
  }
```

Result Example: 

```graphql
{
  "_id": "619ae0456c26299bbd006ad2",
  "name": "C++ for Programmers",
  "building": "AA"
}
```
