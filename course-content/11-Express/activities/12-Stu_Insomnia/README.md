# 🏗️ Query Express.js App Using Insomnia

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use Insomnia to test endpoints that I created using Express.js, to debug my API.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created an Express.js server that hosts on `http://localhost:3001`.

* It's done when I have created an endpoint for `/api` that will return a list of pull requests for a given GitHub repository.

---

## 💡 Hints

Do we need to pass a request body to the server when we are using query parameters?

How can the [GitHub Docs on pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls) help us with usage?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you save multiple request URLs in Insomnia Core?

* It's done when my endpoint accepts multiple queries for `organization` and `repository`.

* It's done when I have tested my endpoints by performing a GET request in Insomnia to both `api/organization` and `/api/repository` and verified that the desired results for each route are returned.
