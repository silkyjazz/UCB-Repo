# 📐 Linked List 

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./code-review).


## Linked List


* Linked Lists are data structures in which each element of the list is sequentially joined to the next element.

* Linked lists keep track of the position of elements using pointers which explicitly point to the “connected item”.

* Each element (called nodes) track both the item and the “next item’s” position.


Four basic operations that you conduct on a Linked List:


* Insert O(1)
* Delete O(1)
* Modify O(1)
* Search O(n)
