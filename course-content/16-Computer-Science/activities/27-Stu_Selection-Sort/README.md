# üìê Selection Sort

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./code-review).


1. Go through the array, find the index of the lowest element swap the lowest element with the first element.

2. The first element is the lowest element in the array.

3. Do it again, go through the array (excluding the first element) and
find the index of the lowest and swap it with the second element.

```That is how it continues to select (finds) the lowest element of the array and putting it on the left until it hits the last element.```
