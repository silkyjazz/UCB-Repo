// The basic parts of a sentence are the subject and the verb. 
// The subject is usually a noun—a word (or phrase) that names a person, place, or thing. The verb (or predicate) usually follows the subject and identifies an action or a state of being. See if you can identify the subject and the verb in each of the following short sentences:

// The hawk soars.
// The boys laugh.
// My daughter is a wrestler.
// The children are tired.
