# 📐 Stack and Queue 

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./code-review).


## Stacks 


* Only allow access to the top element.

* Stacks obey “LIFO” (Last-in-first-out). This means that new elements are placed at the top and removed from the top.


## Queue 

* Only allow access to the first element.

* These data structures obey “FIFO” (First-in-first-out). This means that new elements are placed at the “back” but that the “first” element is removed from the front.
