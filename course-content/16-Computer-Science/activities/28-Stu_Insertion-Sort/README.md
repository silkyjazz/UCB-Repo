# 📐 Insertion Sort

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a sorting function that sorts an array in the following way: 


```
Start at the beginning of the array
Move into a loop
Compare only 2 values
Swap if left is more than right
Repeat until this current value is greater than the left value
OR the current value is at the far left of the array (the zero index)
```
